# GIU File Renamer

## Introduction

I did this project for the people of the **GIU**

No more **mess**,
No more scattered downloads,
No more manual renaming

Now you can know with ease what file you just downloaded.

## Setup

1. Install from chrome store (soon!!!)

## Setup for development

1. Open your chrome extension tab
2. Turn on developer mode
3. Click on load unpacked and choose the manifest.json file

## TODO

1. Download files in bulk
